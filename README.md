This project has two parts:

Exercise 1 involves reading numbers from a txt file, creating images from them, plotting each image on the edge of a circle, and then rotating each image 1 degree counterclockwise every frame

Exercise 2 involves following a set of logical instructions to create a dot plot which produces a very fancy image if done correctly
